# COMP3111 on VSCode

For those whose dislike Eclipse...

Programming on an IDE is almost always an overkill, especially when you are faced with a buggy, laggy and outdated IDE called Eclipse. 
Yet that's what HKUST forced us to do (once on COMP1022P, now on COMP3111/H).
This repository aims to be a reference for those who like to use VSCode and Docker to develop.
If you don't know either of them, this repo is possibly not for you.

Feel free to post PRs or Issuse.
